Abstract :

Hospitals or rather healthcare systems form a major part of human life. Hence the importance of an efficient system to manage all the processes in a hospital cannot be undermined. This motivated us, a student group aimed towards the betterment of society, to design a software system that would easily integrate the different departments in a hospital. 

The Online Hospital Management System project puts forward a simple but effective interface which can be easily familiarised by anyone new to the system. The system helps hospitals in completely automating the procedures of a hospital within the constraints of the virtual world, thus reducing both the errors and manual labour of humans significantly.

The system contains various modules. The system interface is designed to support mainly two groups of users which are the doctors and the patients. The various modules covered by the project includes patient, doctor, appointment, pharmacy, laboratory and blood bank. The patient module deals with collecting essential information from patients including contact details, patient history, prescription details, provision to update existing information or delete patient details. The doctor module handles availability of the doctors in a hospital. It contains a section for the doctors to update their schedule regarding their duty leaves. After the doctors have updated their schedule, the data of all the doctors available in total and for a particular day is available. The appointment module allows the user to take new appointments, and view the appointment both by date and doctor opted. The pharmacy module deals with the stock of medicines where the user can search for any medicine, check the stocks for availability and update the list with new medicines when necessary. The lab module covers everything from test entry to lab record.
